Migrations are very powerful and let you change your models over time, as you develop your project, without the need to delete your database or tables and make new ones - it specializes in upgrading your database live, without losing data. We’ll cover them in more depth in a later part of the tutorial, but for now, remember the three-step guide to making model changes:

    Change your models (in models.py).

    Run python manage.py makemigrations to create migrations for those changes

    Run python manage.py migrate to apply those changes to the database.
